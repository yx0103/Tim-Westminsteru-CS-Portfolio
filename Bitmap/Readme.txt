This project is an extensive programming assignment focusing on understanding and manipulating bitmap (.bmp) image files using C programming. It incorporates advanced concepts such as binary file I/O, memory-mapped I/O, pointer manipulation, and dynamic memory allocation to develop a deeper understanding of low-level file handling and image processing.

Key Learning Objectives:

	1.	Binary File I/O: Learn how to read and write binary files, specifically the .bmp file format, which stores images in an uncompressed bitmap format.
	2.	Memory-Mapped I/O: Utilize mmap() to map files directly into memory for more efficient access and manipulation.
	3.	Pointer Manipulation: Work directly with pointers to access and modify specific parts of the image file.
	4.	Dynamic Memory Allocation: Use malloc() to allocate memory dynamically for storing image pixel data.
	5.	Bitmap Image Structure: Understand the layout of a .bmp file, including headers and pixel data.
