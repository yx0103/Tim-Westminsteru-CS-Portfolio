OBook is an AI-powered, voice-first e-reading application that seamlessly blends high-quality text-to-speech narration, natural-language voice commands, and on-demand LLM‐driven definitions, translations, and summaries. Developed over a semester in React Native, it supports EPUB and TXT formats, converting and parsing ebooks via the Convertio API, streaming cached audio from Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, and handling voice input through Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. Conversational queries are routed to Google Gemini for concise, context-aware answers, while a lightweight API and local caching minimize latency. Key UX features include dynamic sentence-level highlighting, a floating control bar, dark/sunshine modes, a driving-mode for eyes-free listening, and intuitive gestures like two-finger swipes. In usability testing, OBook achieved a 180 ms median response time, improved task completion by 20 s on average, and received strong positive feedback for accessibility and engagement.

Throughout the project, I gained deep experience in orchestrating complex, multimodal pipelines—principally the event-driven coordination of TTS playback and LLM responses—which taught me the importance of robust message-queuing and race-condition mitigation. Leveraging ChatGPT as a coding partner honed my review processes, reminding me to validate AI-generated imports and logic. I also sharpened my React Native UI skills, adopting design tokens to ensure consistency and accessibility, and cultivated disciplined time-boxing and test-driven development habits. This project not only reinforced my technical mastery of cross-platform mobile architectures and cloud AI services, but also solidified my ambition to create assistive technologies that unite conversational intelligence with user-centric design.
