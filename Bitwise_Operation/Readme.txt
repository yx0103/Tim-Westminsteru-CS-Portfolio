This project is a programming assignment focused on understanding and manipulating the binary representation of double-precision floating-point numbers using a combination of C and assembly language. The goal is to deepen your understanding of how floating-point numbers are stored in memory, including their sign, exponent, and fraction components, and to learn to manipulate these fields using bitwise operations.

Key Learning Objectives:

	1.	Bit Manipulation: Understand and use C’s bit operators (&, |, <<, >>) to extract and assemble parts of a number at the binary level.
	2.	Assembly Language: Modify and create assembly code for reinterpreting data types (e.g., converting between double and long without altering bit representation).
	3.	Binary Representation of Floating-Point Numbers: Learn how IEEE 754 double-precision format encodes numbers using 64 bits:
	•	1 bit for the sign (positive or negative).
	•	11 bits for the exponent.
	•	52 bits for the fraction/mantissa.
	4.	C and Assembly Interfacing: Write and integrate assembly routines with C functions to handle binary operations not natively supported in C.
