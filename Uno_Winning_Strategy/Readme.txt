This project is a comprehensive Java programming assignment focused on developing a complete implementation of the popular card game Uno, along with customizable player strategies. The objective is to build a fully functional game engine, create different player classes with distinct strategies, and participate in a class-wide competition to determine the most effective player strategy. The project is broken down into multiple milestones and includes writing code, testing, and documenting strategies.

Key Learning Objectives:

	1.	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Gain deeper understanding and practice with OOP concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, by extending and modifying classes.
	2.	Game Logic Implementation: Implement game mechanics that adhere to the official Uno rules and exceptions defined for the project.
	3.	Design Patterns and Strategy Development: Create player classes that implement different strategies for playing Uno, and evaluate their performance in simulated games.
	4.	Unit Testing: Use provided test classes and create additional tests to ensure code correctness and compliance with game rules.
	5.	Version Control and Collaboration: Use GitHub for version control, committing code regularly, and collaborating through code reviews.
