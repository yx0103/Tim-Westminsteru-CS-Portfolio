Our CMPT 322 project, “Hoodies n a Dream,” delivers a browser‑based, multiplayer math‑racing game aimed at 1st–2nd graders. 
Up to three students connect to a shared room code, choose a difficulty (single‑ or double‑digit addition/subtraction), 
and race cartoon cars around a track by answering 20 timed equations. Correct answers propel the car forward; mistakes impose a short delay, 
creating real‑time competition that ends when the first car crosses the finish line. A post‑game screen shows the leaderboard and offers an instant rematch for all players. 
The stack centers on Deno for the server (handling room management, WebSocket messaging, and question logic) and a lightweight JS/HTML/CSS front‑end, giving teachers an easy,
Nitro‑Type‑style tool to reinforce arithmetic fluency.

Building the prototype taught me far more than the syntax of new tools.
I learned how to design a real‑time, event‑driven architecture—spawning
and synchronizing game rooms, streaming questions, and updating each client’s state without race conditions. 
On the front end I practiced crafting UI that’s attractive yet cognitively accessible to early‑elementary students,
balancing bright visuals with minimal text. Coordinating a four‑person team forced disciplined Git workflows and agile task‑splitting,
while Deno’s permissions model drove home modern security principles. Overall, the project deepened my understanding of full‑stack web development,
multiplayer networking, and the pedagogical mechanics that turn raw math drills into genuinely engaging play.
